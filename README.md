# YOLO-Licence-Plate-Detection
This project implements automatic car license plate detection using YOLO v9, and trained on a custom dataset obtained from Kaggle. It utilizes pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract license plate numbers from detected plates. The application is deployed using Streamlit for easy user interaction.

## Features
- Upload Media: Allows users to upload images or videos for license plate detection.
- Real-time Processing: Capable of processing both images and videos, displaying results promptly.
- Output Visualization: Displays annotated images or processed videos with bounding boxes around detected license plates and recognized text overlay.
